### Day 1: September 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone over some new JavaScript concepts (Promises and async/await) and have put together a plan for the projects I want to create during this challenge! First up will be a growth mindset progress tracker that includes a small game that serves as a motivational tool.

**Thoughts** I am excited to do this challenge and hope to build a lot of useful and interesting projects!
