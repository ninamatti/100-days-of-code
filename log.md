### Day 1: September 1, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone over some new JavaScript concepts (Promises and async/await) and have put together a plan for the projects I want to create during this challenge! First up will be a growth mindset progress tracker that includes a small game that serves as a motivational tool.

**Thoughts** I am excited to do this challenge and hope to build a lot of useful and interesting projects!

### Day 2: September 2, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I started with the basic html structure for my progress tracker and thought about how I want the whole page to look/where each element should go.

**Thoughts** I am looking forward to getting to the most interesting parts of this project such as the little motivation flower garden game that I want to implement; however, there are still a lot of basics that I need to get right before I can move on to that step.

### Day 3: September 3, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on how I want the task list of my progress tracker to be structured. Also solved a couple of JavaScript challenges on plantyourcode.com.

**Thoughts** Solving the challenges was fun but took quite some time. For my progress tracker, I am tempted to jump ahead to the parts that seem the most fun, but I know I should be patient and get the basic structure first.

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the day creating a mock-up of facebook's newsfeed with randomly generated posts, a post input field and updated timestamps.
